## class 7

this is important to learn because going forward, i think we'll probably be working with objects quite a bit.  Learning a bit about html tables will be extremely useful when we need to display information in a clear and concise way.

### explain why we need domain modeling
    - to target specific problems.  to keep and store data in an organized fashion

### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
    - tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired user.
    - they produce tag soup,  making code harder to write, maintain and debug
    - they arent automatically responsive

### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in HTML <table>
    - <th> table header.  a special cell that goes at the start of a row or column
    - <tr> table row.  creates a single row for the info
    - <td> table data.  the smallest element in the table where you put your data

### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
    - a function to create an object.  You want to use it when you are creating more than 1 object    

### How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
    - you are binding "this" to the object, and now able to use this in your constructor code
