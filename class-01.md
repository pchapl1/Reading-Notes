## Day 1 Reading notes

### Why this matters
    It is important to learn the basics.  These are going to be the building blocks of the front end of our projects from here on out.  

### Describe how HTML, CSS and JS files are parsed in the browser.
    The browser will request an html file from the server.  HTML files will often contain links to external stylesheets and scripts.  It parses html first, the browser will find any link or script tag and know where to access those elements. As it parses the html, it will send requests back to the server for links and scripts and then parse those links and scripts. 

### How can you find images to add to a website?
    You can perform google searches for images.  You can also load images that you may have on your local machine

### How do you create a String vs a Number in JS?
    if you want to create a string, enclose the data you type in single or double quotes
    string example: 
        let myString = "hello"
    number example:
        let myNumber = 8

### What is a variable and why are they important in JS?
    A variable is a way for you store data.  They are important because you need them to persist any kind of data and easily reference that data later.

### What is an html attribute?
    they are extra information about a specific element that doesnt appear on the page but can be used to manipulate or affect that element.

### what is the difference between <article> and <section> element tags?
    an article tag encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page.

    a section tag is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes a single piece of functionality.
