## SQL and Database summary
Relational db's are way more strict that nonsql dbs.  Its data is separated into rows and columns and makes it pretty straightforward to access data until you need to start performing joins.  Then it can be a little more tricky.  Sql is a structured query language that is used to access data from these relational dbs.  Getting general, non complicated information is fairly simple but as stated before, it can become a bit tricky to access data when you need to perform joins.  Upon further reading, its cool that you can perform aggregates and counts on tables with some fairly easily queries.
