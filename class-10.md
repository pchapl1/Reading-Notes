### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
    - syntax : usually a spelling error or a typo.  syntax errors will also usually be indicated by a red line generated in your ide or text editor

    - logic : the code is syntatically fine but it is not performing what you want it to perform. Usually no indicators are given when there is a logic error 

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
    - ive encountered variables undefined.  usually i didnt put "let" or "this" in front of the variable name
    - expected ")" error.  just forgot to put a closing parenthesis
    - ive also seen an error where i tried to use an array method on an object.  and just had to loop through the object differently

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
    - It will help influence my thought process when writing code.  Clearly define what im trying to do with my code so i am able to better avoid logic errors and code slowly so i dont run into syntax errors

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
    - it is a problem solving tool that allows you to stop your code at specific points to check values of variables and what is happening at specific points in your code

### Define what a breakpoint is.
    - a break point is a place in the code that you want to stop the code running
